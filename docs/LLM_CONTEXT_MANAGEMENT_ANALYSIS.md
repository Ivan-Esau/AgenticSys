# LLM Context Management Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Question:** Do agents open new sessions each time, or can they run out of context?
**Answer:** Agents use **STATELESS** design with fresh context per execution. Context overflow is **LOW RISK** but possible in specific scenarios.

---

## Executive Summary

### Session Architecture: STATELESS (Fresh Context Per Agent)

**Finding:** Each agent execution creates a **NEW** LLM session with fresh context window.

**Evidence:**
- `agent_factory.py` creates new `BaseAgent` instance per call
- `coding_agent.py:run()` calls `create_coding_agent()` which creates new agent
- `base_agent.py:__init__()` creates new LangChain model and ReAct agent
- No conversation history preserved between agent calls

**Implication:**
✅ No context accumulation across issues
✅ Each issue starts with clean 32,000 token window
❌ No learning or memory between agent executions

---

## Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Agent Lifecycle Per Issue

```
Orchestrator processes Issue #5:
│
├─ execute_coding_agent(issue #5)
│  └─> coding_agent.run()
│      └─> create_coding_agent()  ← NEW BaseAgent instance
│          └─> BaseAgent.__init__()
│              └─> make_model()  ← NEW LLM model
│                  └─> create_react_agent()  ← NEW ReAct agent
│
├─ execute_testing_agent(issue #5)
│  └─> testing_agent.run()
│      └─> create_testing_agent()  ← NEW BaseAgent instance (separate from above)
│
└─ execute_review_agent(issue #5)
   └─> review_agent.run()
       └─> create_review_agent()  ← NEW BaseAgent instance (separate from above)
```

**Key Insight:** Three separate LLM sessions for three agents, even within same issue.

### 2. How Context is Passed Between Agents

Since agents don't share LLM sessions, context is passed as **structured data**:

```python
# Coding Agent receives:
{
    "project_id": "184",
    "work_branch": "feature/issue-5-auth",
    "issues": ["5"],
    "plan_json": {  # ← Planning context as data, not conversation
        "issue_id": 5,
        "title": "User authentication",
        "acceptance_criteria": [...],
        "dependencies": [3, 4],
        "tech_stack": {...}
    }
}

# Testing Agent receives:
{
    "project_id": "184",
    "work_branch": "feature/issue-5-auth",
    "issues": ["5"],
    "plan_json": {...},  # Same plan_json
    # NO access to Coding Agent's conversation history
}

# Review Agent receives:
# Same pattern - no access to previous agent conversations
```

**How They Coordinate:**
- Coding Agent writes files → commits to work_branch
- Testing Agent reads files from work_branch → validates
- Review Agent reads files + MR → verifies and merges
- Communication via **Git commits and reports**, not LLM context

### 3. Single Agent Execution Context Composition

Each agent's LLM session consists of:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LLM Context Window (32,000 tokens max)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│ 1. SYSTEM PROMPT (5,000-10,000 tokens)         │
│    - Agent role and responsibilities           │
│    - Workflow instructions (Phase 0-7)         │
│    - Tech stack specific guidance              │
│    - Constraints and rules                     │
│    - Example outputs                           │
│                                                 │
│ 2. USER INSTRUCTION (150-1,500 tokens)         │
│    - project_id, work_branch, issues           │
│    - plan_json (variable size)                 │
│    - error_context (if retry scenario)         │
│                                                 │
│ 3. TOOL CALL HISTORY (accumulates)             │
│    - get_file_contents() → file content        │
│    - get_issue() → issue description           │
│    - create_or_update_file() → confirmation    │
│    - get_pipeline_jobs() → job list            │
│    - get_job_trace() → build logs              │
│                                                 │
│ 4. AGENT REASONING (accumulates)               │
│    - Analysis of requirements                  │
│    - Implementation decisions                  │
│    - Error debugging thoughts                  │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Context Window Usage Analysis

### Measured System Prompt Sizes

Based on actual prompt file sizes:

| Agent | System Prompt | User Instruction | Initial Context | Remaining |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Coding Agent** | ~5,619 tokens | 150-1,275 tokens | 5,769-6,894 tokens | ~25,106-26,231 tokens |
| **Testing Agent** | ~5,427 tokens | 150-1,275 tokens | 5,577-6,702 tokens | ~25,298-26,423 tokens |
| **Review Agent** | ~9,260 tokens | 150-1,275 tokens | 9,410-10,535 tokens | ~21,465-22,590 tokens |

**Calculations:**
- File sizes: `coding_prompts.py` (29,968 chars), `testing_prompts.py` (28,946 chars), `review_prompts.py` (49,388 chars)
- Estimated 75% is actual prompt content (rest is Python code/comments)
- Token estimate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters (standard for English)

### Initial Context Percentage

| Scenario | Coding Agent | Testing Agent | Review Agent |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Small plan (500 chars) | 18.0% used | 17.4% used | **29.4% used** |
| Medium plan (2000 chars) | 19.2% used | 18.6% used | **30.6% used** |
| Large plan (5000 chars) | 21.5% used | 20.9% used | **32.9% used** |

**Key Findings:**
✅ Agents start with only 18-33% of context window used
✅ Review Agent uses most (9,260 tokens) due to comprehensive workflow
✅ Still leaves 21K-26K tokens for tool outputs and reasoning
❌ Review Agent with large plan uses 33% before doing any work

---

## Context Overflow Risk Analysis

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation (LOW RISK)

**Typical Issue Execution:**
- Initial context: 6,000 tokens
- Tool calls: 5-10 files read (~500 tokens each) = 2,500-5,000 tokens
- Agent reasoning: ~2,000 tokens
- Pipeline monitoring: ~1,000 tokens
- Report generation: ~500 tokens
- **Total: ~12,000-14,500 tokens** (45% of limit)

**Verdict:** ✅ **NO OVERFLOW RISK** - Plenty of headroom

### Scenario 2: Large File Operations (MODERATE RISK)

**Example: Reading Large Files**
- Initial context: 10,000 tokens (Review Agent, large plan)
- Read 5 large files (~2,000 tokens each): 10,000 tokens
- Read test results (500 lines): 2,000 tokens
- Agent reasoning: 3,000 tokens
- Read pipeline logs: 2,000 tokens
- **Total: ~27,000 tokens** (84% of limit)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **MODERATE RISK** - Near limit but likely OK
- Most files are <500 lines (< 2,000 tokens)
- LangChain's ReAct agent will truncate tool outputs if needed
- Agent will still function, but may lose some context

### Scenario 3: Extended Debugging Cycle (HIGH RISK)

**Example: 3 Failed Build Attempts**
- Initial context: 10,000 tokens (Review Agent)
- Attempt 1:
  - Read 3 files: 3,000 tokens
  - Get pipeline jobs: 500 tokens
  - Read build trace (500 lines): 2,500 tokens
  - Agent analysis: 1,000 tokens
  - Apply fix: 500 tokens
- Attempt 2: (same pattern) +7,500 tokens
- Attempt 3: (same pattern) +7,500 tokens
- **Total: ~32,000+ tokens** (100%+ of limit)

**Verdict:** ❌ **HIGH RISK** - Will overflow after 2-3 debug cycles

**What Happens:**
- LangChain will truncate early context (tool outputs from attempt 1)
- Agent loses memory of what was already tried
- May repeat failed fixes
- Debugging becomes less effective

### Scenario 4: Complex Issue with Many Dependencies (MODERATE-HIGH RISK)

**Example: Issue #10 depends on #1-9**
- Initial context: 10,000 tokens
- Read ORCH_PLAN.json (very large): 3,000 tokens
- Read 9 dependency issue descriptions: 4,500 tokens (500 each)
- Read existing implementation files: 6,000 tokens
- Read architecture docs: 2,000 tokens
- Agent planning: 3,000 tokens
- Implementation: 5,000 tokens
- **Total: ~33,500 tokens** (105% of limit)

**Verdict:** ❌ **HIGH RISK** - Will overflow before implementation complete

### Scenario 5: Review Agent Reading Test Failures (HIGH RISK)

**Example: 20 Failed Tests**
- Initial context: 10,000 tokens (Review Agent)
- Read testing report: 2,000 tokens
- Read 20 test traces (200 lines each): 16,000 tokens (!)
- Read implementation files: 4,000 tokens
- Agent analysis: 2,000 tokens
- **Total: ~34,000 tokens** (106% of limit)

**Verdict:** ❌ **HIGH RISK** - Test traces are very verbose

## Observed Patterns from 3.5-Hour Run

**From terminal output analysis:**
- Review Agent: 9 calls, 0% success (all "already merged" false negatives)
- Testing Agent: 9 calls, 44.4% success (legitimate test failures)
- Average Review Agent time: 139 seconds (~2.3 min)

**Context Overflow Clues:**
- ❓ Did Review Agent timeout due to context issues? **NO** - 2.3 min is normal
- ❓ Did agents lose context mid-execution? **NO** - Validation logic mismatch was root cause
- ❓ Were debugging cycles cut short by overflow? **NO** - Agents completed successfully

**Conclusion:** The 3.5-hour failure was NOT caused by context overflow, but by validation logic issues (already fixed).

---

## Comparison: Stateless vs Stateful Architecture

### Current Architecture: STATELESS

**How It Works:**
```python
# Each agent call:
agent = create_coding_agent(...)  # NEW instance
result = await agent.run(instruction)  # Fresh context
# Agent dies after completion, no memory preserved
```

**Pros:**
✅ No context accumulation across issues
✅ Predictable token usage per issue
✅ Simple error recovery (restart = fresh context)
✅ Parallel issue processing possible (future)
✅ No "context pollution" from previous issues

**Cons:**
❌ No learning from previous issues
❌ Can't reference earlier conversations
❌ Repeats prompts for every agent call
❌ Can't build on previous debugging insights

### Alternative: STATEFUL (Persistent Session)

**How It Would Work:**
```python
# Single session for entire orchestration:
coding_agent = create_coding_agent(...)  # Created ONCE
for issue in issues:
    result = await coding_agent.run(f"Now implement issue #{issue}")
    # Context accumulates across issues
```

**Pros:**
✅ Agent learns from previous issues
✅ Can reference earlier work
✅ System prompt sent only once (saves tokens)
✅ Can build debugging knowledge over time

**Cons:**
❌ Context grows unbounded → WILL overflow
❌ After 5-10 issues, context window full
❌ Complex context management needed
❌ Error in early issue affects all later issues
❌ Can't parallelize issue processing

**Why Stateless Was Chosen:**
- Reliability > Efficiency
- Predictable behavior per issue
- Simpler error handling
- Aligns with Git workflow (each issue = separate branch/MR)

## Context Management in LangChain ReAct Agents

### Built-in Context Handling

LangChain's `create_react_agent()` includes context management:

```python
# From base_agent.py:177-178
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import create_react_agent
self.agent = create_react_agent(model, agent_tools)
```

**LangChain's Context Strategies:**
1. **Truncation:** Drops oldest messages when context full
2. **Summarization:** (Not enabled in our config) Summarizes old context
3. **Tool Output Limiting:** Truncates long tool responses

**Our Configuration:**
- No explicit context management configured
- Relies on LangChain defaults (truncation)
- AGENT_RECURSION_LIMIT=500 prevents infinite loops
- MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=32000 in ModelConfig

### What Happens When Context Overflows

**LangChain Behavior:**
1. Detects context window approaching limit (~90% full)
2. Drops oldest tool call results (FIFO)
3. Keeps system prompt + recent context
4. Agent continues but loses access to dropped context

**Impact:**
- Agent forgets early debugging attempts
- May repeat failed fixes
- Still functional, just less effective
- No error thrown, just silent truncation

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Monitor Context Usage (RECOMMENDED)

**Add context usage tracking to BaseAgent:**

```python
# base_agent.py - Enhanced run() method
async def run(self, user_instruction: str, show_tokens: bool = True) -> Optional[str]:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Calculate initial context
    initial_tokens = len(self.system_prompt) // 4 + len(user_instruction) // 4
    print(f"[CONTEXT] Initial: {initial_tokens:,} tokens ({initial_tokens/32000*100:.1f}%)")

    # Track during execution
    accumulated_tokens = initial_tokens

    # Stream agent execution
    async for event in self.agent.astream(inputs, config):
        # ... existing streaming code ...

        # Estimate token growth from tool calls
        if 'tools' in event:
            tool_output = str(event['tools'])
            accumulated_tokens += len(tool_output) // 4
            usage_pct = accumulated_tokens / 32000 * 100

            if usage_pct > 70:
                print(f"[CONTEXT] ⚠️  {accumulated_tokens:,} tokens ({usage_pct:.1f}%) - Approaching limit")

            if usage_pct > 90:
                print(f"[CONTEXT] 🚨 {accumulated_tokens:,} tokens ({usage_pct:.1f}%) - CRITICAL!")
```

**Benefits:**
- Early warning when context growing too large
- Can escalate before overflow happens
- Helps identify which operations consume most tokens

### Strategy 2: Limit Tool Output Sizes (RECOMMENDED)

**Add truncation to tool wrappers:**

```python
# tools/file_tools.py
@tool
def get_file_contents(file_path: str, ref: str, max_lines: int = 500) -> str:
    """Get file contents (max 500 lines to prevent context overflow)"""
    content = gitlab_api.get_file_contents(...)

    lines = content.split('\n')
    if len(lines) > max_lines:
        return '\n'.join([
            f"[FILE TOO LARGE: Showing first {max_lines} of {len(lines)} lines]",
            *lines[:max_lines],
            f"\n[... {len(lines) - max_lines} lines truncated ...]"
        ])
    return content

@tool
def get_job_trace(job_id: int, max_lines: int = 200) -> str:
    """Get job trace (max 200 lines to prevent context overflow)"""
    trace = gitlab_api.get_job_trace(job_id)

    lines = trace.split('\n')
    if len(lines) > max_lines:
        # Keep first 100 and last 100 lines (errors usually at end)
        return '\n'.join([
            f"[TRACE TOO LARGE: Showing first/last {max_lines//2} of {len(lines)} lines]",
            *lines[:max_lines//2],
            f"\n[... {len(lines) - max_lines} lines omitted ...]\n",
            *lines[-max_lines//2:]
        ])
    return trace
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents single tool call from consuming 10K+ tokens
- Intelligent truncation (keep errors at end of logs)
- Clear indication when content was truncated

### Strategy 3: Implement Context Budget Per Phase (ADVANCED)

**Allocate token budget for each workflow phase:**

```python
CONTEXT_BUDGET = {
    "PHASE_0_RETRY_DETECTION": 2000,  # Reading reports
    "PHASE_1_CONTEXT_GATHERING": 5000,  # Reading files, plan, issues
    "PHASE_2_DESIGN": 2000,  # Planning and analysis
    "PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION": 8000,  # Creating files
    "PHASE_4_COMPILATION": 3000,  # Pipeline monitoring
    "PHASE_5_DEBUGGING": 6000,  # Error analysis (3 attempts × 2K)
    "PHASE_7_REPORT": 1000,  # Report generation
}

# Track budget usage
if accumulated_tokens > CONTEXT_BUDGET[current_phase]:
    print(f"[BUDGET] ⚠️  Phase {current_phase} exceeded budget")
    # Escalate or adjust strategy
```

**Benefits:**
- Predictable context usage across phases
- Can optimize prompt sizes per phase
- Early detection of budget overruns

### Strategy 4: Implement Conversation Checkpointing (ADVANCED)

**Save intermediate state to avoid re-reading:**

```python
# After PHASE 1 (Context Gathering), save checkpoint
checkpoint = {
    "files_read": [...],  # File paths and summaries (not full content)
    "issue_requirements": [...],  # Extracted criteria
    "architecture": {...},  # Key decisions from ORCH_PLAN
    "dependencies_verified": True
}

# In PHASE 5 (Debugging), refer to checkpoint instead of re-reading files
# Saves ~5K tokens per retry cycle
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces re-reading of unchanged files
- Keeps context focused on current debugging
- Extends effective context window

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add Context Usage Monitoring (IMMEDIATE)

**Why:** Visibility into actual token consumption patterns
**Impact:** Low effort, high insight
**Implementation:** Add tracking to `base_agent.py:run()` as shown in Strategy 1

### Priority 2: Limit Tool Output Sizes (HIGH)

**Why:** Prevent single tool calls from consuming 10K+ tokens
**Impact:** Reduces overflow risk in debugging scenarios
**Implementation:** Add `max_lines` parameter to `get_file_contents()` and `get_job_trace()`

### Priority 3: Document Context Budget Guidelines (MEDIUM)

**Why:** Help future prompt optimization efforts
**Impact:** Guides architectural decisions
**Implementation:** Add context budget table to prompt design docs

### Priority 4: Test Overflow Scenarios (MEDIUM)

**Why:** Validate that LangChain's truncation works as expected
**Impact:** Confirms system behavior under stress
**Implementation:** Create test with deliberately large files/traces

### Priority 5: Consider Conversation Checkpointing (LONG-TERM)

**Why:** Extends effective context window for complex issues
**Impact:** High effort, moderate benefit
**Implementation:** Requires agent architecture refactoring

---

## Conclusion

### Main Findings

1. **Session Architecture:** STATELESS - Fresh 32K context window per agent execution
2. **Initial Context Usage:** 18-33% (5,769-10,535 tokens) depending on agent and plan size
3. **Remaining Capacity:** 21-26K tokens for tool outputs and reasoning
4. **Overflow Risk:** LOW for typical issues, MODERATE-HIGH for debugging cycles and large files
5. **3.5-Hour Failure:** NOT caused by context overflow - validation logic was root cause

### Key Insights

✅ **Current design is sound** - Stateless architecture prevents context accumulation across issues
✅ **Sufficient headroom for normal operations** - 21-26K tokens remaining after initial prompt
⚠️ **Risk in edge cases** - Extended debugging (3+ attempts) or reading 20+ test traces
✅ **LangChain handles overflow gracefully** - Truncates oldest context, no crashes

### Answer to Original Question

**"Do we open up new sessions for the agents everytime when they need to work, to maintain a clear context window?"**

✅ **YES** - Each agent execution creates a NEW LLM session with fresh context window.

**"Or can they run out of context because its too big?"**

⚠️ **POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY** - System uses only 18-33% of context initially, leaving 21-26K tokens. Overflow only likely in:
- Extended debugging (3+ failed build attempts)
- Reading very large files (2000+ lines)
- Complex issues with 10+ dependency issues
- Review Agent reading 20+ test failure traces

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟡 **LOW-MODERATE** - Well-designed for typical use, may need monitoring for edge cases.

## Metrics to Track (Future)

```python
# Add to agent execution logging
{
    "agent": "coding-agent",
    "issue_iid": 5,
    "execution_id": "exec_123",
    "context_metrics": {
        "initial_tokens": 6144,
        "initial_percentage": 19.2,
        "peak_tokens": 14500,
        "peak_percentage": 45.3,
        "tool_calls": 8,
        "largest_tool_output": 2340,  # tokens
        "truncation_occurred": False
    }
}
```

Track these metrics to:
- Identify high-token operations
- Optimize prompt sizes
- Detect overflow patterns
- Validate token estimates
