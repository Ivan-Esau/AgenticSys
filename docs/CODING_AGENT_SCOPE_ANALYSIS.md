# Coding Agent Scope Management Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Version:** 1.0
**Focus:** Issue scope adherence and boundary detection

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of Coding Agent prompts reveals **strong foundation but 6 critical gaps** in scope boundary detection, dependency checking, and out-of-scope functionality identification.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **Strong:** "Implement ONE issue at a time" directive
- ‚úÖ **Strong:** Acceptance criteria coverage requirements
- ‚úÖ **Strong:** Architecture adherence from ORCH_PLAN.json
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** No dependency issue checking before implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** No out-of-scope functionality detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** No guidance on minimal vs. complete implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** Acceptance criteria not emphasized as scope boundary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** No check for related/blocked issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap:** No guidance on when functionality belongs in another issue

## Current Scope Management

### ‚úÖ What Works Well

#### 1. Single Issue Focus (Line 464)
```
‚úÖ CODING AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES:
‚Ä¢ Implement ONE issue at a time
```

**Strength:** Clear directive

#### 2. Acceptance Criteria Coverage (Lines 421-430)
```markdown
## üìù Acceptance Criteria Coverage (from GitLab Issue)
- [X] Criterion 1: {{description}} - Implemented in {{file:line}}
- [X] Criterion 2: {{description}} - Implemented in {{file:line}}
(List ALL acceptance criteria from issue - NONE should be unchecked)
```

**Strength:** All criteria must be covered

#### 3. Minimal Changes Principle (Line 249)
```
3. **Minimal Changes:** Only add what's required for this issue
```

**Strength:** Encourages focused implementation

#### 4. Issue Fetching Required (Lines 216-229)
```
Step 3 - Issue Analysis (MANDATORY - Fetch Full Issue):
‚Ä¢ Use get_issue(project_id, issue_iid) ‚Üí Get COMPLETE requirements
‚Ä¢ Parse description for:
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Technical requirements
  - Dependencies
  - Edge cases
```

**Strength:** Gets full issue context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps

---

## Gap 1: No Dependency Issue Checking

### Current State
Agent fetches current issue but **doesn't check if it depends on other issues**.

### Problem
If Issue #5 depends on Issue #3 (which implements a required service), agent may:
- Try to implement the missing service itself (scope creep)
- Create incomplete/broken code
- Not realize dependency is missing

### Example Scenario
```
Issue #5: "Add user authentication endpoint"
- Requires: UserService (defined in Issue #3)
- Issue #3 status: Open (not implemented yet)

Agent behavior without dep check:
- Reads Issue #5
- Sees it needs UserService
- Creates UserService itself ‚ùå (should be in Issue #3)
- Scope violation!
```

### Missing Instructions
```
BEFORE implementation:
1. Check ORCH_PLAN.json for issue.dependencies
2. Verify dependency issues are completed
3. If dependency missing:
   - Check if dependency issue exists and is completed
   - If completed: Use existing implementation
   - If not completed: ESCALATE
```

---

## Gap 2: No Out-of-Scope Functionality Detection

### Current State
"Minimal Changes: Only add what's required" is vague - no specific guidance on **identifying** what's required.

### Problem
Agent lacks clear criteria for determining:
- Is this function needed for THIS issue?
- Should this helper class be created now or later?
- Is this feature part of this issue or another one?

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario A: Helper Functions**
```
Issue #7: "Add project creation endpoint"
Acceptance Criteria:
- POST /projects accepts name and description
- Returns created project with ID

During implementation, agent realizes it needs:
- validateProjectName() helper
- generateProjectId() helper
- formatProjectResponse() helper

Questions:
- Which helpers are in scope?
- Which are over-engineering?
- Which might be defined in other issues?

Current prompt: No guidance
```

**Scenario B: Related Features**
```
Issue #10: "Add task editing"
Acceptance Criteria:
- Update task name
- Update task description
- Update task due date

During implementation, agent thinks:
- "Should I also add task deletion?" (No - different issue)
- "Should I add task status update?" (No - different issue)
- "Should I validate due date format?" (Yes - part of editing)

Current prompt: No clear boundary
```

### Missing Instructions
```
SCOPE BOUNDARY DECISION TREE:

For every function/class you consider creating, ask:

1. Is it DIRECTLY needed to satisfy an acceptance criterion?
   - YES ‚Üí In scope
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to #2

2. Is it a minimal helper for code in this issue?
   - YES and < 10 lines ‚Üí In scope
   - YES and > 10 lines ‚Üí Check if it's reusable

3. Will it be used by future issues?
   - YES ‚Üí Check ORCH_PLAN.json - is it planned elsewhere?
   - NO ‚Üí In scope as helper

4. Is it mentioned in issue description/acceptance criteria?
   - YES ‚Üí In scope
   - NO ‚Üí OUT OF SCOPE

When in doubt: Implement ONLY what acceptance criteria explicitly require
```

---

## Gap 3: Acceptance Criteria Not Emphasized as Boundary

### Current State
Acceptance criteria are covered in report (Phase 7) but **not used as scope filter** during implementation (Phase 2-3).

### Problem
Agent implements acceptance criteria BUT may also add extra features not required.

### Current Flow
```
Phase 1: Read issue
Phase 2: Design implementation (no scope check)
Phase 3: Create files (no scope check)
Phase 7: Document acceptance criteria coverage
```

**Missing:** Active filtering during design/implementation

### Needed Enhancement
```
Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN

SCOPE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT:

BEFORE designing any component, verify it satisfies an acceptance criterion:

For each planned file/class/function:
1. Which acceptance criterion does this satisfy?
2. If none ‚Üí Is it absolutely required infrastructure?
3. If not required ‚Üí SKIP IT

Example:
Acceptance Criteria:
  1. User can create project with name
  2. Project must have unique name
  3. Return project ID on creation

Planned components:
‚úÖ createProject(name) ‚Üí Satisfies #1
‚úÖ validateUniqueName() ‚Üí Satisfies #2
‚úÖ generateProjectId() ‚Üí Satisfies #3
‚ùå updateProject() ‚Üí NOT in criteria ‚Üí OUT OF SCOPE
‚ùå deleteProject() ‚Üí NOT in criteria ‚Üí OUT OF SCOPE
‚ùå ProjectAuditLogger ‚Üí NOT in criteria ‚Üí OUT OF SCOPE
```

---

## Gap 4: No ORCH_PLAN.json Dependency Checking

### Current State
Agent reads ORCH_PLAN.json for architecture BUT **doesn't check issue dependencies or implementation order**.

### Problem
ORCH_PLAN.json may contain:
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue_id": 3,
      "title": "Implement UserService",
      "dependencies": [],
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "issue_id": 5,
      "title": "Add authentication endpoint",
      "dependencies": [3],  // Depends on Issue #3!
      "priority": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Agent implementing Issue #5 **doesn't check** that Issue #3 must be done first.

### Missing Instructions
```
Phase 1: CONTEXT GATHERING

Step 2.5 - Dependency Verification:

Extract from ORCH_PLAN.json:
1. Find current issue in issues array
2. Check "dependencies" field
3. For each dependency:
   - Verify dependency issue is marked as "completed"
   - If not completed: ESCALATE

Example:
```python
current_issue_iid = 5
orch_plan = get_file_contents("docs/ORCH_PLAN.json", ref="master")
plan_data = json.loads(orch_plan)

# Find current issue
current_issue = next(i for i in plan_data['issues'] if i['issue_id'] == current_issue_iid)

# Check dependencies
if 'dependencies' in current_issue and current_issue['dependencies']:
    for dep_id in current_issue['dependencies']:
        dep_issue = get_issue(project_id, dep_id)
        if dep_issue['state'] != 'closed':
            ESCALATE(f"Issue #{current_issue_iid} depends on Issue #{dep_id} which is not completed (status: {dep_issue['state']})")
```
```

---

## Gap 5: No Guidance on Feature Granularity

### Current State
No guidance on whether to implement a feature **fully** or **minimally**.

### Problem
**Example: Validation**
```
Issue #8: "Add project creation"
Acceptance Criteria:
- Accept name and description
- Return project object

Validation options:
1. Minimal: Check name is not empty
2. Moderate: Check name length, description length
3. Complete: Check name uniqueness, special characters, XSS, etc.

Which level is in scope?
Current prompt: No guidance
```

### Needed Guidance
```
IMPLEMENTATION GRANULARITY RULES:

1. Acceptance Criteria Explicit?
   - "Must validate name length < 100 chars" ‚Üí Implement exactly that
   - "Must accept valid name" ‚Üí Implement minimal validation (not empty)

2. Error Handling?
   - If acceptance criteria mention error cases ‚Üí Implement them
   - If not mentioned ‚Üí Implement basic error handling only

3. Edge Cases?
   - If acceptance criteria mention edge cases ‚Üí Implement them
   - If not mentioned ‚Üí Implement happy path only

4. Validation?
   - Implement ONLY validations mentioned in acceptance criteria
   - Do not add "nice to have" validations

**Principle:** Implement what's required, not what's ideal
**Rationale:** Other issues may define additional validations
```

---

## Gap 6: No Related Issue Discovery

### Current State
No instruction to check if similar/related issues exist.

### Problem
Agent may duplicate work or implement something planned elsewhere.

### Example
```
Issue #12: "Add task filtering by status"

Related issues (that agent doesn't check):
- Issue #15: "Add task sorting" (might share filtering code)
- Issue #18: "Add task search" (might use same query logic)

Agent implements task filtering in isolation, then:
- Issue #15 duplicates filtering logic for sorting
- Issue #18 duplicates again for search
- Code duplication across 3 issues
```

### Missing Instructions
```
Phase 1: CONTEXT GATHERING

Step 3.5 - Related Issue Check:

AFTER reading current issue, check for related issues:

```python
# Search for related issues
current_issue_title = "Add task filtering by status"
keywords = ["task", "filter", "query", "search"]

# Check ORCH_PLAN.json for related issues
all_issues = plan_data.get('issues', [])
related_issues = [
    i for i in all_issues
    if any(kw in i['title'].lower() for kw in keywords)
    and i['issue_id'] != current_issue_iid
]

if related_issues:
    print(f"[INFO] Found {len(related_issues)} related issues:")
    for issue in related_issues:
        print(f"  - Issue #{issue['issue_id']}: {issue['title']}")
    print("[INFO] Consider code reuse opportunities")
    print("[INFO] Avoid duplicating functionality")
```

**Decision Making:**
- If related issue is COMPLETED ‚Üí Reuse its code/patterns
- If related issue is PLANNED ‚Üí Keep implementation minimal, note for future refactoring
- If no related issues ‚Üí Implement independently
```

## Enhancement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add Scope Boundary Phase (CRITICAL)

Insert **Phase 1.5: SCOPE BOUNDARY ANALYSIS** between context gathering and implementation design:

```markdown
PHASE 1.5: SCOPE BOUNDARY ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)

üö® DEFINE EXACT SCOPE before any implementation

SCOPE DEFINITION WORKFLOW:

1. Extract Acceptance Criteria as Scope Boundary:
```python
issue = get_issue(project_id, issue_iid)
description = issue['description']

# Extract acceptance criteria
criteria_section = extract_section(description, ["Acceptance Criteria", "Akzeptanzkriterien"])
criteria = parse_criteria_list(criteria_section)

print(f"[SCOPE] This issue has {len(criteria)} acceptance criteria")
print(f"[SCOPE] Implementation MUST satisfy ALL criteria")
print(f"[SCOPE] Implementation MUST NOT add features beyond criteria")

for idx, criterion in enumerate(criteria, 1):
    print(f"  {idx}. {criterion}")
```

2. Check Issue Dependencies (from ORCH_PLAN.json):
```python
orch_plan = json.loads(get_file_contents("docs/ORCH_PLAN.json", ref="master"))

# Find current issue in plan
current_issue_plan = next(
    (i for i in orch_plan.get('issues', []) if i.get('issue_id') == issue_iid),
    None
)

if current_issue_plan and current_issue_plan.get('dependencies'):
    print(f"[DEPENDENCIES] Issue #{issue_iid} depends on: {current_issue_plan['dependencies']}")

    # Verify dependencies are completed
    for dep_id in current_issue_plan['dependencies']:
        dep_issue = get_issue(project_id, dep_id)
        if dep_issue['state'] != 'closed':
            ESCALATE(
                f"Cannot implement Issue #{issue_iid}: "
                f"depends on Issue #{dep_id} (status: {dep_issue['state']}). "
                f"Wait for dependency to be completed first."
            )

    print(f"[DEPENDENCIES] ‚úÖ All dependency issues are completed")
else:
    print(f"[DEPENDENCIES] No dependencies - can proceed")
```

3. Identify Out-of-Scope Elements:
```python
# Common out-of-scope indicators
out_of_scope_indicators = [
    "also implement",  # "Also implement deletion" ‚Üí separate issue
    "in addition",      # "In addition, add sorting" ‚Üí separate issue
    "would be nice",    # "Would be nice to have X" ‚Üí not required
    "future",           # "Future enhancements" ‚Üí not now
    "optional"          # "Optional feature X" ‚Üí not required
]

for indicator in out_of_scope_indicators:
    if indicator in description.lower():
        print(f"[WARNING] Issue description contains '{indicator}' - verify scope carefully")
```

4. Define Scope Boundaries:
```
[SCOPE BOUNDARIES DEFINED]

IN SCOPE (from acceptance criteria):
- Create project with name and description
- Validate name is not empty
- Return project with generated ID

OUT OF SCOPE (not in acceptance criteria):
‚ùå Project editing (different issue)
‚ùå Project deletion (different issue)
‚ùå Project listing (different issue)
‚ùå Project permissions (different issue)
‚ùå Audit logging (not mentioned)
‚ùå Email notifications (not mentioned)

MINIMAL HELPERS ALLOWED:
‚úÖ validateProjectName() - needed for criterion #2
‚úÖ generateProjectId() - needed for criterion #3
‚ùå ProjectValidator class - over-engineering for this issue
```

CRITICAL RULE:
**If it's not in acceptance criteria and not a minimal helper (< 10 lines), it's OUT OF SCOPE**
```

---

### Priority 2: Enhance Phase 2 with Scope Filtering (HIGH)

Modify **Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN** to actively filter components:

```markdown
PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN

Design Principles:
1. **Follow Architecture:** Use ORCH_PLAN.json architecture decisions
2. **Match Existing Patterns:** Analyze existing code style and structure
3. **Satisfy Acceptance Criteria ONLY:** Every component must map to a criterion
4. **Minimal Implementation:** Implement exactly what's required, nothing more
5. **Test-Driven:** Consider how to test each component
6. **Dependencies:** Add to requirements.txt/pom.xml/package.json

SCOPE-FILTERED DESIGN PROCESS:

Step 1: Map Acceptance Criteria to Components
For each acceptance criterion, identify required components:

Example:
Criterion 1: "User can create project with name and description"
‚Üí Components: createProject() method, Project class

Criterion 2: "Project name must be unique"
‚Üí Components: checkNameUniqueness() method

Criterion 3: "Return project with generated ID"
‚Üí Components: generateId() method

Step 2: Review Planned Components
For each planned component, verify:
- Which criterion does it satisfy?
- Is it absolutely necessary?
- Could it be in another issue?

Example:
‚úÖ createProject() ‚Üí Satisfies criterion #1
‚úÖ checkNameUniqueness() ‚Üí Satisfies criterion #2
‚úÖ generateId() ‚Üí Satisfies criterion #3
‚úÖ Project class ‚Üí Infrastructure for all criteria
‚ùå updateProject() ‚Üí NOT in any criterion ‚Üí SKIP
‚ùå deleteProject() ‚Üí NOT in any criterion ‚Üí SKIP
‚ùå ProjectValidator class ‚Üí Over-engineering ‚Üí SKIP (use simple functions)
‚ùå ProjectRepository class ‚Üí Might be in another issue ‚Üí Check ORCH_PLAN

Step 3: Check ORCH_PLAN for Deferred Components
If you need a component that seems complex/reusable:
- Check if it's planned in another issue
- If yes: Use minimal stub/placeholder
- If no: Implement minimally for this issue only

Example:
Need: UserService (to get user info)
Check ORCH_PLAN: Issue #8 implements UserService
Status: Issue #8 is completed ‚úÖ
Action: Use existing UserService

OR:

Need: EmailService (to send notifications)
Check ORCH_PLAN: Issue #15 will implement EmailService
Status: Issue #15 is not started ‚ùå
Action: Skip email feature OR escalate if required
```

---

### Priority 3: Add Completion Scope Verification (MEDIUM)

Add to **Phase 7: AGENT REPORT** a scope adherence verification:

```markdown
## üéØ Scope Adherence Verification

BEFORE creating report, verify scope boundaries were respected:

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- [ ] ALL acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] NO criteria left uncovered
- [ ] NO additional features implemented beyond criteria

**Out-of-Scope Check:**
- [ ] No features implemented that weren't in acceptance criteria
- [ ] No "nice to have" features added
- [ ] No functionality from other issues implemented
- [ ] Helper functions are minimal (< 10 lines) or required

**Dependency Check:**
- [ ] All dependency issues were completed before implementation
- [ ] No dependency functionality implemented in this issue

IF any check fails ‚Üí Review implementation and remove out-of-scope code
```

---

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Scope Detection
1. Add Phase 1.5: Scope Boundary Analysis
2. Add dependency checking from ORCH_PLAN.json
3. Add acceptance criteria extraction and mapping

### Week 2: Design Filtering
1. Enhance Phase 2 with scope filtering
2. Add component-to-criterion mapping
3. Add out-of-scope detection

### Week 3: Verification
1. Add scope adherence verification to Phase 7
2. Test with real issues
3. Refine based on feedback

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Before Enhancements:
- ‚ùå Agent may implement features from other issues
- ‚ùå Agent may add "helpful" features not required
- ‚ùå Agent may start issues before dependencies are ready
- ‚ùå Agent may create unnecessary helper classes
- ‚ùå Scope defined vaguely ("implement this issue")

### After Enhancements:
- ‚úÖ Agent checks dependencies before starting
- ‚úÖ Agent maps every component to acceptance criterion
- ‚úÖ Agent skips out-of-scope features
- ‚úÖ Agent implements minimally and precisely
- ‚úÖ Scope defined explicitly (exact list of criteria)
- ‚úÖ Clear boundary between in-scope and out-of-scope

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Scope Adherence Rate:** % of implementations that only include required features
   - Target: > 95%

2. **Dependency Detection:** % of times agent correctly identifies missing dependencies
   - Target: 100%

3. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage:** % of criteria covered
   - Target: 100%

4. **Out-of-Scope Prevention:** % of times agent avoids implementing extra features
   - Target: > 90%

5. **Code Reuse:** % of times agent reuses code from completed dependency issues
   - Target: > 80%

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Scope strictness:** Should agent NEVER add features beyond acceptance criteria, or allow minimal helpers?

2. **Dependency handling:** What if dependency issue is incomplete but agent could implement missing piece?

3. **Granularity:** Should all validation/error handling be explicit in acceptance criteria?

4. **Related issues:** Should agent proactively suggest refactoring when it sees duplication opportunities?
