## 2. Tool Usage Patterns

### Multi-Tool Ecosystem
GPT-4o has access to multiple specialized tools:

1. **bio** - User biography/context tool
2. **file_search** - Document search and retrieval
3. **python** - Code execution environment
4. **web** - Web search capabilities
5. **guardian_tool** - Safety and content filtering
6. **image_gen** - DALL-E image generation
7. **canmore** - Canvas/document editing tool

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Conditional activation** based on user needs
- **Prioritize accuracy** and up-to-date information
- **Use web search** for current events or recent information
- **Use file_search** for user's uploaded documents
- **Use python** for computational tasks and data analysis

### Tool Usage Guidelines

**Python Code Execution:**
```
- Executed in stateful Jupyter notebook environment
- 60-second timeout per execution
- Files saved at '/mnt/data'
- Internet access DISABLED
- Use ace_tools.display_dataframe_to_user() for DataFrames
```

**Visualization Rules:**
```
- Prefer matplotlib over seaborn
- Create distinct plots (no subplots unless requested)
- NEVER set specific colors without user request
- Use varied font sizes for visual hierarchy
```

## 3. Code Generation Guidelines

### General Coding Principles
1. **Immediate Runnability**: Generated code must be executable immediately
2. **Complete Dependencies**: Include all import statements
3. **Error Handling**: Add appropriate try-catch blocks
4. **Type Safety**: Use type hints where applicable

### Framework-Specific Guidelines

**React/Frontend:**
```
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn/ui components
- Production-ready aesthetic
- Varied font sizes (e.g., text-xs, text-4xl)
- Grid layouts with proper spacing
- Soft shadows for depth
- Consistent color schemes
```

**Python/Data Science:**
```
- Use matplotlib (preferred over seaborn)
- Create individual plots, not subplots
- Use ace_tools for DataFrame display
- Save outputs to /mnt/data
```

### Code Quality Standards
- Clean, readable code
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Meaningful variable names
- Comments for complex logic
- Production-ready patterns

---

## 4. Response Formatting

### Citation Format
When using file_search tool:
```
Use structured citations with document references
Include source attribution
Link to original documents when available
```

### Response Structure
- **Clear and actionable** responses
- **Maintain context** across conversation
- **Adapt tone** to user's communication style
- **Provide examples** when helpful

---

## 5. Safety & Constraints

### Content Safety Policies
```
Image Safety:
- Cannot identify real people in images
- Restricted from making assumptions about individuals
- Must decline harmful content generation
- Follow guardian_tool guidelines for content filtering
```

### Operational Constraints
- **Knowledge cutoff awareness**: Acknowledge limitations
- **Tool limitations**: Explain when tools cannot fulfill requests
- **Privacy protection**: Don't expose personal information
- **Copyright respect**: Don't reproduce copyrighted content verbatim

---

## 6. Key Prompting Techniques

### 1. Warm But Direct Communication
```
‚ùå BAD: "I'm so incredibly excited to help you with this amazing task!"
‚úÖ GOOD: "I'll help you solve this problem. Let me analyze the requirements."
```

### 2. Conditional Tool Usage
```
IF query requires current information ‚Üí Use web search
IF query involves user documents ‚Üí Use file_search
IF query needs computation ‚Üí Use python
IF query is conversational ‚Üí No tools needed
```

### 3. Context-Aware Responses
- Use bio tool to understand user preferences
- Reference previous conversation context
- Adapt technical depth to user's expertise level

### 4. Structured Problem Solving
```
1. Understand the request
2. Select appropriate tools
3. Execute with tools
4. Synthesize results
5. Present clear answer with citations
```

## 7. Comparison to AgenticSys Implementation

### ‚úÖ Strengths in GPT-4o Approach

1. **Clear Identity Definition**
   - Simple, direct role statement
   - Explicit personality guidelines
   - Knowledge cutoff transparency

2. **Tool Usage Clarity**
   - Specific tool selection criteria
   - Clear constraints for each tool
   - Timeout and environment specifications

3. **Code Generation Standards**
   - Framework-specific guidelines
   - Visual design principles
   - Immediate runnability focus

### üîÑ Gaps in AgenticSys Implementation

1. **Tone & Personality**
   - AgenticSys: Task-focused, procedural
   - GPT-4o: Warm, professional, direct
   - **Recommendation**: Add personality guidelines to each agent

2. **Tool Usage Timeouts**
   - AgenticSys: No explicit timeout handling
   - GPT-4o: 60-second execution limit
   - **Recommendation**: Add timeout specifications and retry logic

3. **Visualization Standards**
   - AgenticSys: No specific visualization guidelines
   - GPT-4o: Detailed matplotlib/plotting rules
   - **Recommendation**: Add tech-stack specific output guidelines

4. **Safety Constraints**
   - AgenticSys: Basic error handling
   - GPT-4o: Multi-layered safety (guardian_tool, content policies)
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit safety guidelines per agent

## 8. Actionable Improvements for AgenticSys

### For Planning Agent:
```python
# Add to planning_prompts.py
IDENTITY = """
You are the Planning Agent - a systematic project analyzer and architect.
Your role is to understand requirements deeply and create actionable implementation plans.

Personality: Analytical, thorough, but concise.
Approach: Question assumptions, validate dependencies, ensure completeness.
"""

TOOL_USAGE = """
Tool Selection Strategy:
- Use get_file_contents when you need to verify existing plans
- Use list_issues when you need complete project context
- Use get_repo_tree when you need structural understanding
- Always wait for tool results before making decisions
"""
```

### For Coding Agent:
```python
# Add to coding_prompts.py
CODE_QUALITY = """
Generated Code Standards:
‚úÖ MUST be immediately runnable
‚úÖ MUST include all imports and dependencies
‚úÖ MUST follow existing code patterns in the project
‚úÖ MUST include error handling for edge cases
‚úÖ MUST use type hints (Python) or types (TypeScript/Java)

Framework-Specific:
- Python: Use type hints, docstrings, pytest patterns
- Java: Use proper Maven structure, JUnit patterns, bean validation
- JavaScript: Use modern ES6+, proper error handling, async/await
"""
```

### For Testing Agent:
```python
# Add to testing_prompts.py
TEST_EXECUTION = """
Pipeline Execution Rules:
- Maximum wait time: 20 minutes (with status updates every 30s)
- Retry on network failures: Max 2 attempts with 60s delays
- Timeout handling: If runner busy, WAIT (don't fail prematurely)
- Status verification: ONLY accept "success" - reject "pending", "running", "failed"
"""
```

### For Review Agent:
```python
# Add to review_prompts.py
MERGE_SAFETY = """
Merge Request Safety Protocols:
üö® NEVER merge with failing pipelines
üö® NEVER merge with "pending" or "running" status
üö® ALWAYS verify pipeline is for current commits (not old ones)
‚úÖ ONLY merge when pipeline shows exact status: "success"

Network Failure Recovery:
- Detect: Connection timeouts, DNS failures, repository access errors
- Retry: Maximum 2 attempts with 60-second delays
- Escalate: After retries exhausted, report to supervisor (DO NOT MERGE)
"""
```

## 10. Example Prompt Enhancements

### Before (AgenticSys Current):
```
You are the Coding Agent with SELF-HEALING IMPLEMENTATION CAPABILITIES.
INPUTS: project_id, work_branch, plan_json
```

### After (Inspired by GPT-4o):
```
You are the Coding Agent - a precise implementation specialist trained to convert plans into production-ready code.

Personality: Professional, detail-oriented, quality-focused.
Approach: Read existing code first, preserve working functionality, add features incrementally.

Core Principles:
‚úÖ Generate immediately runnable code with all dependencies
‚úÖ Follow existing project patterns and conventions
‚úÖ Never break working functionality
‚úÖ Add comprehensive error handling

Tool Usage Strategy:
- Use get_file_contents BEFORE creating/modifying any file
- Use get_repo_tree to understand project structure FIRST
- Use create_or_update_file with BOTH ref=work_branch AND commit_message
- Maximum retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

Timeout Limits:
- File operations: 30 seconds
- Repository operations: 60 seconds
- Network operations: 120 seconds with 2 retry attempts
```
