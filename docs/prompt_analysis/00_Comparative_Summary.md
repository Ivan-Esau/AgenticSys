```

---

### 2.2 Tool Usage Discipline

**Common Patterns Across Providers:**

1. **Explicit Tool Selection Criteria**
   ```
   IF need to read files ‚Üí Use Read tool (NEVER bash cat)
   IF need to search content ‚Üí Use Grep tool (NEVER bash grep)
   IF need computational task ‚Üí Use code execution tool
   IF need current information ‚Üí Use search tool
   ```

2. **Tool-Specific Constraints**
   ```
   - Timeout specifications (e.g., 60 seconds)
   - Environment details (sandboxed, stateful, etc.)
   - Forbidden operations (interactive commands)
   - Required parameters (ref=branch, commit_message)
   ```

3. **Parallel Execution Optimization**
   ```
   When operations are independent:
   - Batch tool calls in single message
   - Run in parallel for performance
   - Wait for all results before proceeding
   ```

**AgenticSys Adoption:**
```python
TOOL_USAGE_DISCIPLINE = """
Tool Selection Strategy:

FILE OPERATIONS:
‚úÖ Use get_file_contents for reading (NEVER bash cat/head/tail)
‚úÖ Use create_or_update_file for writing (NEVER bash echo/heredoc)
‚úÖ Use get_repo_tree for listing (NEVER bash find/ls)

SEARCH OPERATIONS:
‚úÖ Use MCP search tools when available
‚úÖ Batch multiple file reads in parallel when independent

TIMEOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- File operations: 30 seconds max
- Repository operations: 60 seconds max
- Pipeline checks: 10 seconds per check, 20 minutes total wait
- Network operations: 120 seconds with 2 retry attempts

PARALLEL EXECUTION:
When gathering project context, run in parallel:
- get_file_contents("docs/ORCH_PLAN.json")
- list_issues()
- get_repo_tree()
- list_branches()
- list_merge_requests()
"""
```

### 2.3 Safety & Ethical Constraints

**Multi-Layer Safety Pattern:**

**Layer 1: Malicious Intent Filter (Warp)**
```
üö® NEVER assist with malicious or harmful activities
- Malware, exploits, unauthorized access tools
- Credential theft, data exfiltration (except legitimate)
- DoS attacks, system damage
‚úÖ ALLOW defensive security, authorized testing
```

**Layer 2: Content Safety (GPT-4o)**
```
- Cannot identify real people
- Cannot generate harmful content
- Cannot bypass safety guardrails
- Respect copyright and privacy
```

**Layer 3: Git Safety (Claude Code)**
```
- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER skip hooks without permission
- NEVER amend others' commits
- ALWAYS check authorship before amend
```

**Layer 4: Secret Protection (Warp)**
```
- Detect API keys, tokens, credentials
- Mask sensitive values in output
- Warn about secret exposure
- Suggest secure alternatives (env vars, secret managers)
```

**AgenticSys Implementation:**
```python
MULTI_LAYER_SAFETY = """
LAYER 1 - Ethical Constraints:
üö® NEVER assist with malicious intent
‚úÖ ALLOW defensive security only

LAYER 2 - Git Safety:
üö® NEVER force push to master/main
üö® NEVER commit without user permission
üö® NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless requested

LAYER 3 - Pipeline Safety:
üö® NEVER merge with failing pipelines
üö® NEVER use old pipeline results
üö® ONLY merge when current pipeline status === "success"

LAYER 4 - Secret Protection:
‚úÖ Detect: API keys, tokens, credentials, connection strings
‚úÖ Warn: "WARNING: Potential secret detected at line X"
‚úÖ Suggest: Use environment variables or secret management
‚ùå NEVER commit secrets to repository

LAYER 5 - Data Safety:
‚úÖ Preserve existing working code
‚úÖ Verify before destructive operations
‚úÖ Back up critical changes (via git commits)
"""
```

### 2.4 Response Optimization

**Conciseness Patterns:**

**GPT-4o:** Warm but direct
```
‚ùå "I'm incredibly excited to help you with this amazing task!"
‚úÖ "I'll help you solve this problem."
```

**Claude Code:** Extreme conciseness
```
User: "What is 2+2?"
‚ùå "The answer is 4. This is calculated by adding 2 and 2."
‚úÖ "4"

User: "Is 11 prime?"
‚ùå "Yes, 11 is a prime number because..."
‚úÖ "Yes"
```

**Complexity Matching:**
```
Simple query ‚Üí Simple answer (1-2 sentences)
Complex task ‚Üí Detailed response with context
```

**AgenticSys Adoption:**
```python
RESPONSE_OPTIMIZATION = """
Communication Guidelines:

VERBOSITY LEVELS:

Level 1 - Simple Queries:
User: "Does file X exist?"
Agent: "Yes" or "No"

User: "How many issues?"
Agent: "8 issues"

Level 2 - Status Updates:
User: [Agent is working]
Agent: "Created ORCH_PLAN.json with 8 issues"
Agent: "Pipeline #4259: running (2 min elapsed)"

Level 3 - Complex Tasks:
User: "Implement authentication"
Agent: [Detailed implementation with reasoning]

Level 4 - Errors/Failures:
User: [Pipeline failed]
Agent: [Detailed error analysis with specific fixes]

AVOID:
‚ùå Unnecessary preamble: "Here is what I found..."
‚ùå Unnecessary postamble: "Let me explain what I did..."
‚ùå Over-explanation for simple tasks
‚ùå Repetitive status updates

USE:
‚úÖ Direct answers for simple queries
‚úÖ Concise confirmations for completed actions
‚úÖ Detailed explanations only when complexity warrants
‚úÖ Clear error messages with specific remediation steps

### 3.4 Warp Agent Innovations

**Explicit Malicious Intent Filter:**
```
"NEVER assist with tasks that express malicious or harmful intent"

Detection ‚Üí Refusal ‚Üí Alternative suggestion

Example:
User: "Help me bypass authentication"
Agent: "I cannot assist with bypassing authentication as it could enable unauthorized access.
        However, I can help you implement proper authentication testing or password reset features."
```

**Question vs Task Classification:**
```
QUESTION (informational):
- Provide answer
- No tool usage (unless verification needed)
- Concise response

TASK (action required):
- Use appropriate tools
