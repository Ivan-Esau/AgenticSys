- Use available tools for verification

### 2. Multiple Possible Answers

```
"Present multiple possible answers if available"
```

**When to Use:**
- Ambiguous questions
- Multiple valid solutions
- Different approaches possible
- Trade-offs exist between options

**Example Pattern:**
```
User: "How should I implement authentication?"

Response:
There are several approaches:

1. Session-based authentication
   - Pros: Simple, server-controlled
   - Cons: Scalability challenges

2. JWT tokens
   - Pros: Stateless, scalable
   - Cons: Token invalidation complexity

3. OAuth 2.0
   - Pros: Industry standard, delegated auth
   - Cons: Implementation complexity

Recommendation: [Context-specific advice]
```

### 3. Comprehensive Responses

```
"Provide comprehensive responses"
```

- Cover all relevant aspects
- Include context and background
- Explain trade-offs
- Provide examples when helpful

### 4. Temporal Awareness

```
"Use current date for time-dependent information"
```

- Always consider current date
- Update recommendations based on latest information
- Acknowledge when information may be outdated

### 5. Language Adaptation

```
"Answer in the language of the question"
```

- Mirror user's language choice
- Maintain consistency throughout response
- Adapt technical terms appropriately

### 6. Source Rephrasing

```
"Rephrase source information"
```

- Don't copy-paste from sources verbatim
- Synthesize and summarize
- Add context and explanation
- Attribute when necessary

## 3. Tool Usage Patterns

### Code Execution Tool

**Python Execution Environment:**
```python
# Available libraries (example from prompt):
print(Google Search(queries=['query1', 'query2']))
```

**Characteristics:**
- Sandboxed Python environment
- Specific library access
- Search integration capabilities
- Output capture and display

**Usage Pattern:**
```
IF task requires computation â†’ Write and execute Python code

## 4. Response Formatting

### Mathematical & Scientific Notation

**LaTeX Formatting:**
```
Use LaTeX formatting for mathematical/scientific notation
Enclose with '$' or '$$' delimiters

Examples:
Inline: $E = mc^2$
Display: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$$
```

**When to Use LaTeX:**
- Mathematical equations
- Scientific formulas
- Chemical notation
- Complex symbols

## 5. Key Prompting Techniques

### 1. Multi-Perspective Analysis

**Pattern:**
```
Problem: [User's question]

Perspective 1: [First approach]

Perspective 2: [Second approach]
- Benefits: ...
- Drawbacks: ...

Perspective 3: [Third approach]
- Benefits: ...
- Drawbacks: ...

Recommendation: [Context-based guidance]
```

### 2. Accuracy-First Approach

**Decision Tree:**
```
1. Do I have verified information? â†’ Provide answer
2. Can I verify with tools? â†’ Use tools, then answer
3. Uncertain? â†’ Acknowledge uncertainty, provide caveats
4. Don't know? â†’ Explicitly state limitation
```

### 3. Comprehensive But Structured

**Response Structure:**
```
1. Direct Answer (if simple question)
   OR
   Overview (if complex question)

2. Detailed Explanation
   - Key concepts
   - Important considerations
   - Trade-offs

3. Examples (when helpful)

4. Recommendations (when applicable)
```

### 4. Language-Aware Communication

**Adaptation Pattern:**
```
Detect question language â†’
Match response language â†’
Adapt technical terms â†’
Maintain consistency
```

## 7. Actionable Improvements for AgenticSys

### For Planning Agent:

**Add Multi-Solution Analysis:**
```python
SOLUTION_ANALYSIS = """
When creating implementation plans:

1. Analyze Multiple Approaches:
   - Approach A: [Description]
     Pros: ...
     Cons: ...
     Best for: ...

   - Approach B: [Description]
     Pros: ...
     Cons: ...
     Best for: ...

2. Recommend Based on Context:
   - Project size: [consideration]
   - Team expertise: [consideration]
   - Timeline: [consideration]
   - Recommendation: [specific choice with reasoning]

3. Document Decision Rationale in ORCH_PLAN.json
"""
```

### For Coding Agent:

**Add Accuracy Verification:**
```python
ACCURACY_VERIFICATION = """
Before implementing code:

1. Verify Requirements:
   âœ… Read issue description completely
   âœ… Confirm understanding of acceptance criteria
   âœ… Check for ambiguities â†’ Ask for clarification if needed
   âœ… Verify dependencies are available

2. Verify Existing Code:
   âœ… Use get_file_contents to read ALL related files
   âœ… Understand existing patterns and conventions
   âœ… Confirm integration points
   âœ… Check for potential conflicts

3. Verify Implementation:
   âœ… Code matches requirements exactly
   âœ… All edge cases handled
   âœ… Error handling in place
   âœ… Follows existing project patterns

4. Acknowledge Uncertainty:
   IF unsure about requirements â†’ Document assumptions in code comments
   IF multiple valid approaches â†’ Choose one and document reasoning
   IF edge case unclear â†’ Implement conservative approach
"""
```

### For Testing Agent:

**Add Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
```python
COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING = """
Test Planning Strategy:

1. Identify Test Scenarios:
   - Happy path: Normal expected usage
   - Edge cases: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, null values
   - Error cases: Invalid inputs, error conditions
   - Integration: Interaction with other components

2. Multiple Test Approaches:
   - Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods
   - Integration tests: Test component interactions
   - End-to-end tests: Test complete workflows

3. Coverage Analysis:
   - Aim for comprehensive coverage of core functionality
   - Prioritize critical paths
   - Document uncovered scenarios with reasoning

4. Test Quality:
   - Clear test names describing what is being tested
   - Independent tests (no interdependencies)
   - Predictable outcomes (no flaky tests)
   - Fast execution (avoid unnecessary delays)
"""
```

### For Review Agent:

**Add Temporal Context:**
```python
TEMPORAL_CONTEXT = """
Review Considerations:

1. Timeline Awareness:
   - How long has this branch been open?
   - Are there conflicts with master due to age?
   - Have dependencies been updated since branch creation?

2. Freshness Checks:
   - Is the implementation using latest patterns from master?
   - Are there newer dependencies available?
   - Have coding standards changed?

3. Documentation:
   - Record review date in MR comments
   - Note any temporal concerns
   - Flag if implementation may be outdated

## 9. Example Prompt Enhancement

### Before (AgenticSys Current - Planning Agent):
```
2) CREATE PROJECT FOUNDATION (NO PIPELINE MODIFICATIONS):
   - ESSENTIAL PROJECT STRUCTURE:
     * Create basic directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
     * Add minimal dependencies file
```

### After (Inspired by Gemini):
```
2) ANALYZE AND RECOMMEND PROJECT STRUCTURE:

   TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Current date: [DYNAMIC]
   - Consider latest best practices for [detected_tech_stack]
   - Use current framework versions

   STRUCTURE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:

   Option A: Minimal Structure (Recommended for small projects)
   - Structure: src/, tests/, docs/
   - Dependencies: Essential only
   - Pros: Simple, fast to set up, easy to understand
   - Cons: May need restructuring as project grows
   - Best for: Small projects, prototypes, < 5 issues

   Option B: Standard Structure (Recommended for medium projects)
   - Structure: src/, tests/, docs/, config/, scripts/
   - Dependencies: Core + common utilities
   - Pros: Room for growth, organized, industry standard
   - Cons: More initial setup
   - Best for: Medium projects, team collaboration, 5-15 issues

   Option C: Enterprise Structure (Recommended for large projects)
   - Structure: Modular architecture with separate packages
   - Dependencies: Full stack with dev/test/prod separation
   - Pros: Highly scalable, enterprise-grade, robust
   - Cons: Complex initial setup, steeper learning curve
   - Best for: Large projects, multi-team, 15+ issues

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Analyze: [project size], [team size], [issue count]
   - Choose: [Option X] because [reasoning]
   - Document: Record decision rationale in ORCH_PLAN.json

   VERIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING:
   âœ… Confirmed project requirements are understood
   âœ… Checked for existing structure conventions in GitLab
   âœ… Verified tech stack is current/supported
   âœ… Acknowledged any assumptions made
```

**Conclusion**: Gemini's prompt design emphasizes accuracy, comprehensiveness, and multi-perspective analysis. AgenticSys can benefit significantly from adopting these patterns, particularly around presenting multiple solution options, explicit verification steps, and temporal awareness in decision-making.
