## Changes Made

### 1. Phase 3: Enhanced Pipeline Monitoring (Lines 305-327)

**Before:**
```python
if status == "success":
    proceed_to_phase_4()
elif status in ["pending", "running"]:
    wait()
elif status == "failed":
    proceed_to_phase_4_debugging()
```

**After:**
```python
if status == "success":
    proceed_to_phase_5_verification()
elif status in ["pending", "running"]:
    wait()
elif status == "failed":
    proceed_to_phase_4_debugging()
elif status in ["canceled", "skipped"]:
    print(f"[ERROR] Pipeline {status} - cannot continue")
    ESCALATE(f"Pipeline {status} - manual intervention needed")
elif status == "manual":
    ESCALATE("Pipeline requires manual action")
else:
    ESCALATE(f"Unknown pipeline status: {status}")
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Handles canceled pipelines (prevents infinite wait)
- ✅ Handles skipped pipelines (prevents false success)
- ✅ Handles manual pipelines (escalates properly)
- ✅ Handles unknown statuses (safety net)

---

### 2. Phase 4: Job Filtering & Multi-Failure Prioritization (Lines 354-377)

**Added:**
```python
# Filter for YOUR test jobs only
test_jobs = [j for j in jobs if any(keyword in j['name'].lower()
             for keyword in ['test', 'pytest', 'junit', 'jest', 'coverage'])]

failed_jobs = [j for j in test_jobs if j['status'] == 'failed']

# If multiple failures, prioritize dependency/collection errors
if len(failed_jobs) > 1:
    critical_jobs = []
    for job in failed_jobs:
        trace = get_job_trace(job_id=job['id'])
        if any(pattern in trace.lower() for pattern in [
            'modulenotfounderror', 'collection error', 'cannot import'
        ]):
            critical_jobs.append(job)

    if critical_jobs:
        failed_jobs = critical_jobs  # Fix critical first
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Filters for test jobs explicitly (scope enforcement)
- ✅ Prioritizes dependency errors (one fix may solve all failures)
- ✅ Reduces redundant debugging attempts

---

### 3. Phase 4: Framework-Specific Error Patterns (Lines 398-418)

**Before:**
```
- **Network errors:** Wait 60s, retry pipeline
- **Dependency errors:** Add missing dependency
- **Syntax errors:** Fix syntax in test file
```

**After:**
```
**PYTHON (pytest):**
- `modulenotfounderror` / `no module named 'X'` → Add X to requirements.txt
- `syntaxerror` / `indentationerror` → Fix syntax in test file
- `assertionerror` / `assert X == Y` → Review test logic
- `fixture` / `conftest` → Fix fixture definitions
- `collection error` → Add __init__.py or fix imports
- `timeout` / `connection refused` → Retry after 60s (transient)

**JAVA (JUnit):**
- `classnotfoundexception` → Add dependency to pom.xml
- `compilation failure` → ESCALATE (Coding Agent's job)
- `expected: <X> but was: <Y>` → Review assertion
- `mockito` / `nullpointerexception` → Fix mocking/setup

**JAVASCRIPT (Jest):**
- `cannot find module` → Check imports and package.json
- `timeout` / `exceeded timeout` → Increase timeout or fix async
- `unable to find element` → Fix component queries/rendering
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Specific patterns to search for (no guessing)
- ✅ Framework-specific guidance
- ✅ Direct action for each pattern
- ✅ Faster error classification

---

### 4. Phase 4: Trace Parsing Guidance (Lines 379-396)

**Added:**
```python
# Get error summary (errors usually at end)
lines = trace.split('\n')
error_summary = '\n'.join(lines[-50:])

# Extract specific error details
# pytest: "FAILED tests/test_X.py::test_name - ErrorType: message"
# junit: "testName(TestClass) -- Error: message"
# jest: "● TestSuite › test name ... Error: message"

print(f"[DEBUG] Analyzing error in {job['name']}")
print(f"[ERROR_SUMMARY] {error_summary[:500]}...")
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Focus on last 50 lines (where errors are)
- ✅ Framework-specific error formats documented
- ✅ Print summary for visibility

---

### 5. Phase 5: Multi-Job Verification (Lines 414-459)

**Before:**
```python
pipeline = get_pipeline(pipeline_id=YOUR_PIPELINE_ID)
assert pipeline['status'] == 'success'

jobs = get_pipeline_jobs(pipeline_id=YOUR_PIPELINE_ID)
test_job = [j for j in jobs if 'test' in j['name'].lower()][0]  # First job only!
assert test_job['status'] == 'success'
```

**After:**
```python
# STEP 1: Verify pipeline status
pipeline = get_pipeline(pipeline_id=YOUR_PIPELINE_ID)
status = pipeline['status']
assert status == 'success', f"Pipeline status must be 'success', got: {status}"

# STEP 2: Get and filter YOUR test jobs only
jobs = get_pipeline_jobs(pipeline_id=YOUR_PIPELINE_ID)
test_jobs = [j for j in jobs if any(keyword in j['name'].lower()
             for keyword in ['test', 'pytest', 'junit', 'jest', 'coverage'])]

# CRITICAL: Verify test jobs exist
assert test_jobs, "CRITICAL: No test jobs found in pipeline!"
print(f"[VERIFY] Found {len(test_jobs)} test jobs: {[j['name'] for j in test_jobs]}")

# STEP 3: Verify ALL test jobs succeeded (not just first one)
for job in test_jobs:
    assert job['status'] == 'success', f"Test job '{job['name']}' status: {job['status']}"

# STEP 4: Verify tests actually executed in each job
for job in test_jobs:
    trace = get_job_trace(job_id=job['id'])
    trace_lower = trace.lower()

    # Check for test execution
    has_execution = any(pattern in trace_lower for pattern in [
        'passed', 'failed', 'test', 'tests run'
    ])
    assert has_execution, f"No test execution in '{job['name']}'"

    # Check for "0 tests"
    has_zero_tests = any(pattern in trace_lower for pattern in [
        '0 passed', 'no tests', '0 tests collected'
    ])
    assert not has_zero_tests, f"Zero tests executed in '{job['name']}'"

    # Check no failures
    if 'failed' in trace_lower and '0 failed' not in trace_lower:
        assert False, f"Found test failures in '{job['name']}'"

print("[VERIFY] ALL CHECKS PASSED")
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Checks ALL test jobs (not just first)
- ✅ Verifies job filtering worked (test jobs found)
- ✅ Verifies tests executed in EACH job
- ✅ Verifies zero tests detected in EACH job
- ✅ Verifies no failures in EACH job
- ✅ Clear error messages for debugging
- **Critical: Prevents false successes**

---

### 6. Constraints: Updated Completion Requirements (Lines 617-630)

**Before:**
```
✅ YOUR_PIPELINE_ID status === "success"
✅ All test jobs show "success"
✅ Tests actually executed (verified in traces)
✅ No failing tests
```

**After:**
```
✅ YOUR_PIPELINE_ID status === "success" (NOT "canceled", "skipped", "pending", "running")
✅ Test jobs filtered correctly (test/pytest/junit/jest/coverage keywords)
✅ ALL test jobs show "success" (checked every single one, not just first)
✅ Tests actually executed in ALL jobs (verified in traces)
✅ No test jobs with zero tests executed
✅ No failing tests in any job
✅ Pipeline is for current commits (< 30 min old)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Explicit status exclusions
- ✅ Job filtering verification required
- ✅ Multi-job emphasis (ALL, not just first)
- ✅ Zero-test detection
- ✅ Pipeline freshness check

---

### 7. Constraints: Updated "NEVER Signal Completion" (Lines 649-660)

**Before:**
```
❌ Pipeline is "pending", "running", "failed", "canceled"
❌ Tests didn't actually run
❌ Using old pipeline results
```

**After:**
```
❌ Pipeline is "pending", "running", "failed", "canceled", "skipped", "manual"
❌ No test jobs found in pipeline (job filtering failed)
❌ ANY test job status !== "success"
❌ Tests didn't actually run in ANY job
❌ Zero tests executed in ANY job
❌ ANY test failures found in traces
❌ Using old pipeline results (> 30 min old)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Added "skipped" and "manual" statuses
- ✅ Job filtering failure detection
- ✅ Multi-job failure detection (ANY)
- ✅ Specific time threshold (30 min)

---

## Before vs. After Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Pipeline Statuses Handled** | 4 (success, pending, running, failed) | 7 (added canceled, skipped, manual, unknown) |
| **Job Verification** | First test job only | ALL test jobs |
| **Job Filtering** | Simple `'test' in name` | Multi-keyword filter with verification |
| **Error Patterns** | Generic categories | Framework-specific patterns with actions |
| **Multi-Failure Handling** | Sequential | Prioritized (dependencies first) |
| **Trace Parsing** | No guidance | Focus on last 50 lines, extract error details |
| **Zero Test Detection** | Not checked | Checked in every job |
| **Pipeline Freshness** | Not checked | < 30 min required |
| **False Success Risk** | Medium-High | **Very Low** |

---

## Expected Improvements

### Reliability
- **Before:** Agent could succeed with canceled/skipped pipelines
- **After:** Agent escalates on any non-success status

### Accuracy
- **Before:** Agent might miss failures in secondary test jobs
- **After:** Agent checks EVERY test job individually

### Speed
- **Before:** Random error debugging order
- **After:** Prioritizes dependency errors (fixes root cause first)

### Clarity
- **Before:** Vague patterns like "dependency errors"
- **After:** Specific patterns like `modulenotfounderror` / `no module named 'X'`

---

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Explicit is Better Than Implicit**
   - All possible pipeline statuses explicitly handled
   - All test jobs explicitly checked
   - All verification steps explicitly documented

2. **Fail Fast, Fail Loud**
   - Assert statements with clear error messages
   - Early detection of job filtering failures
   - Escalation on anomalies

3. **Framework-Aware**
   - pytest, JUnit, Jest specific patterns
   - Framework-specific error message formats
   - Framework-appropriate fixes

4. **Zero Tolerance for False Positives**
   - Multiple verification layers
   - Checks for zero tests executed
   - Checks for hidden failures in traces

5. **Concise but Complete**
   - Kept additions practical and focused
   - Removed redundancy
   - Clear, actionable guidance

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases to Verify

1. **Canceled Pipeline:** Verify agent escalates (doesn't wait forever)
2. **Skipped Pipeline:** Verify agent escalates (doesn't report success)
3. **Multiple Test Jobs:** Verify agent checks ALL, not just first
4. **Zero Tests Executed:** Verify agent detects and escalates
5. **Secondary Job Failure:** Verify agent catches failures in job #2, #3, etc.
6. **Dependency Error with Multiple Failures:** Verify agent fixes dependency first
7. **Old Pipeline:** Verify agent rejects pipelines > 30 min old

### Expected Behavior

Each test should show:
- Clear logging of what's being checked
- Explicit verification of each condition
- Proper escalation with informative message
- No false successes

---

## File Metrics

- **Lines:** 756 (increased from 749 by ~7 lines)
- **Characters:** ~26,000
- **Approximate Tokens:** ~6,500
- **Compilation:** ✅ Successful

**Length Assessment:** Acceptable - added critical safety features with minimal length increase.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Real Environment**
   - Run agent with failing pipeline
   - Run agent with multiple test jobs
   - Run agent with canceled pipeline

2. **Monitor Metrics**
   - False success rate (target: 0%)
   - Debug efficiency (target: < 2 attempts)
   - Time to resolution (target: < 5 min)

3. **Gather Feedback**
   - Are error patterns comprehensive?
   - Are verification checks too strict?
   - Any edge cases not covered?

4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Flaky test detection (optional, lower priority)
   - Trace parsing with regex extraction (if needed)
   - Performance optimization (if prompts get too long)

---

## Conclusion

Testing Agent prompts refined to provide:
- ✅ **Complete pipeline status handling** (no more infinite waits on canceled pipelines)
- ✅ **Multi-job verification** (checks ALL test jobs, not just first)
- ✅ **Framework-specific error detection** (faster, more accurate debugging)
- ✅ **Multi-failure prioritization** (fixes root cause first)
- ✅ **Zero tolerance for false successes** (never completes with failing tests)

All while maintaining **concise, practical length** (~6,500 tokens).

**Status:** Ready for testing in production.
