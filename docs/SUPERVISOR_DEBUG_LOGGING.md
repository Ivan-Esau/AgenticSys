# Supervisor Debug Logging Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive debug outputs have been added to `src/orchestrator/supervisor.py` to trace the complete workflow and identify potential problems.

---

## üéØ **Logging Categories**

### **[WORKFLOW]** - Main Flow Steps
Traces the primary execution path through the orchestration system.

### **[DEBUG]** - Detailed State Information
Provides detailed information about variables, parameters, and internal state.

### **[PRIORITY]** - Issue Priority Order
Shows the calculated priority order of issues to be implemented.

### **[OK]** / **[X]** / **[!]** - Status Indicators
- `[OK]` = Success
- `[X]` = Failure
- `[!]` = Warning (non-critical)

### **PHASE 3: Implementation Loop**

```
[WORKFLOW] ============================================================
[WORKFLOW] PHASE 3: Implementation
[WORKFLOW] ============================================================
[WORKFLOW] [1/8] Processing Issue #5: User Authentication
```

**Purpose:** Show which issue is being processed in the queue.

---

### **Step 9.1: Completion Check**

```
[WORKFLOW] Step 9.1: Checking if issue #5 is already completed
[DEBUG] Issue title: User Authentication
[DEBUG] Completion check result: False
```

**Purpose:** Verify if issue needs implementation or can be skipped.

**Skipped Issue Example:**
```
[WORKFLOW] Step 9.1: Checking if issue #5 is already completed
[DEBUG] Issue title: User Authentication
[DEBUG] Completion check result: True
[WORKFLOW] [OK] Issue #5 already closed/merged - skipping
```

---

```

---

### **Step 9.3: Feature Branch Creation**

```

```

---

### **Step 12: PHASE 3/3 - Review Agent**

```
[WORKFLOW] Step 12: PHASE 3/3 - Review Agent Execution
[DEBUG] Target branch: feature/issue-5-user-authentication

### **Error Handling & Retry**

```
[WORKFLOW] [X] Exception occurred during implementation
[DEBUG] Error type: GitLabAPIError
[DEBUG] Error message: 401 Unauthorized

[DEBUG] Recording error in issue tracker
[WORKFLOW] Will retry (attempt 1/3)
```

**Purpose:** Trace exceptions and retry logic.

**Final Failure Example:**
```
[WORKFLOW] [X] All retries exhausted - marking as failed

[WORKFLOW] [X] Issue #5 FAILED after 3 attempts
[WORKFLOW] Finalizing failed issue and exporting to CSV
[DEBUG] Failed issue report exported
```

## üîç **How to Use This Logging**

### **1. Trace Issue Order Problems**
Look for `[PRIORITY]` logs to see calculated implementation order:
```bash
grep "\[PRIORITY\]" logs/orchestrator_run.log
```

### **2. Debug Completion Check Issues**
Look for `Step 9.1` to see why issues are skipped or processed:
```bash
grep "Step 9.1" logs/orchestrator_run.log
```

### **3. Trace Agent Failures**
Look for `[X]` markers to find failing agents:
```bash
grep "\[X\]" logs/orchestrator_run.log
```

### **4. Monitor Retry Attempts**
Look for `[RETRY]` to see which issues needed retries:
```bash
grep "\[RETRY\]" logs/orchestrator_run.log
```

### **5. Verify Planning Branch Merge**
Look for `PHASE 1.5` to see planning branch handling:
```bash
grep "PHASE 1.5" -A 20 logs/orchestrator_run.log
```

## üö® **Common Debug Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Issue Implemented in Wrong Order**
**Look For:**
```
[PRIORITY] Implementation order:
[PRIORITY]   1. Issue #3: ...
[PRIORITY]   2. Issue #5: ...  # Wrong! Should be first
```
**Diagnosis:** ORCH_PLAN.json has incorrect priority order.

---

### **Scenario 2: Issue Skipped Incorrectly**
**Look For:**
```
[WORKFLOW] Step 9.1: Checking if issue #5 is already completed
[DEBUG] Completion check result: True  # But issue is NOT complete!
[WORKFLOW] [OK] Issue #5 already closed/merged - skipping
```
**Diagnosis:** `is_issue_completed()` logic has false positive.

---

### **Scenario 3: Infinite Retry Loop**
**Look For:**
```
[WORKFLOW] [RETRY] Issue #5 - Attempt 2/3
[DEBUG] Coding Agent result: False
[WORKFLOW] [X] Coding phase failed - will retry

[WORKFLOW] [RETRY] Issue #5 - Attempt 3/3
[DEBUG] Coding Agent result: False
[WORKFLOW] [X] Coding phase failed - will retry

[WORKFLOW] [X] All retries exhausted - marking as failed
```
**Diagnosis:** Agent is not fixing the root cause between retries.

---

### **Scenario 4: Planning Branch Not Found**
**Look For:**
```
[WORKFLOW] Step 3: Checking for planning-structure branch
[DEBUG] Available branches: ['master', 'feature/...']
[WORKFLOW] ‚ö†Ô∏è No planning-structure branch found - skipping merge
```
**Diagnosis:** Planning Agent did not create branch (fresh repo).

---

### **Scenario 5: ORCH_PLAN.json Missing**
**Look For:**
```
[WORKFLOW] Step 5: Loading ORCH_PLAN.json from master
[WORKFLOW] ‚ö†Ô∏è ORCH_PLAN.json not found - will use fallback prioritization
```
**Diagnosis:** Planning Agent did not create ORCH_PLAN.json or it wasn't merged.

---

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

After adding debug outputs, verify:

- [ ] All phases (1, 1.5, 2, 3) have clear `[WORKFLOW]` markers
- [ ] Each agent execution (Coding, Testing, Review) has `[DEBUG]` result logging
- [ ] Retry logic shows attempt numbers and delays
- [ ] Completion check shows exact reason for skip/process decision
- [ ] Error handling shows exception type and message
- [ ] Success/failure states are clearly marked with `‚úÖ` or `‚ùå`
- [ ] Analytics export is confirmed with `[DEBUG]` messages

## üéØ **Key Takeaways**

1. **Complete Traceability**: Every major workflow step is logged with numbered steps
2. **Debug Detail**: All critical variables (branch, IID, results) are logged
3. **Status Clarity**: Clear success/failure/warning indicators throughout
4. **Retry Tracking**: Full visibility into retry attempts and reasons
5. **Problem Detection**: Logs designed to quickly identify common issues
6. **CSV Export**: All analytics are logged and exportable for analysis

This logging system enables full end-to-end tracing of the orchestration workflow, making it easy to identify and debug any problems that arise during execution.
